## Bonus: How to Stack These Tools for Maximum Impact

Here's a real workflow I use weekly:

1. **Research topic** → Perplexity AI
2. **Outline content** → ChatGPT/Claude (free tiers)
3. **Write draft** → Copy.ai for headlines, self for body
4. **Create visuals** → Leonardo.ai (images) + Runway (video)
5. **Make presentation** → Gamma App
6. **Record voiceover** → ElevenLabs
7. **Edit video** → Descript

**Total cost:** $0/month

**Time saved:** ~15 hours/week

## The Catch: Why Are These Free?

Most of these tools use a "freemium" model:
- The free tier is genuinely useful (not a bait-and-switch)
- They bet 5-10% of users will upgrade to paid
- They're venture-backed and prioritizing growth over profit (for now)

**My advice:** Use them while they're free. Build them into your workflow. If they start charging, you'll know if they're worth paying for based on actual value delivered.

## Conclusion: The AI Arms Race is YOUR Opportunity

The gap between "people who use AI tools" and "people who don't" is becoming a chasm.

The good news? Most of the best tools are still free. The catch? That won't last forever.

**Bookmark this page.** Try one new tool per week. In 15 weeks, you'll have a productivity superpower most people won't discover for years.

The future isn't coming. It's here. And it's free.

      Most operate on a freemium model—the basic version is free, but with usage limits (e.g., credits per month). As long as they're venture-funded, expect free tiers to continue. Some may eventually become paid-only, but typically they grandfather in early users.
