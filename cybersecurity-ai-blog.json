AI has demolished those assumptions.\n\n### 🚨 AI-Powered Attacks You Need to Know\n\n#### 1. Deepfake Video & Audio Attacks\n\nDeepfakes have moved from entertainment to enterprise fraud. In 2025, a finance employee at a multinational company transferred **$25 million** after a video call with what appeared to be the CFO—it was an AI-generated deepfake.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Attackers scrape public videos of executives (LinkedIn, YouTube, conferences)\n- AI generates realistic video/audio clones\n- Fake \"urgent\" video calls request wire transfers or sensitive data\n\n<div class=\"my-6 p-4 bg-red-50 border-l-4 border-red-400 text-red-800\">\n  <strong>⚠️ Warning:</strong> Deepfake attacks have a 68% success rate when employees haven't received specific training. Voice cloning now requires only 3 seconds of audio sample.\n</div>\n\n#### 2. AI-Generated Phishing (Hyper-Personalization)\n\nForget generic \"Nigerian prince\" emails. AI-powered phishing uses:\n\n- **Large Language Models** to write flawless, personalized emails\n- **Scraped social media data** to reference real projects, colleagues, and events\n- **Automated A/B testing** to optimize open rates in real-time\n\n**Result:** AI-generated phishing emails have a **47% higher click rate** than human-written ones.\n\n#### 3. Automated Vulnerability Scanning\n\nAttackers now deploy AI to:\n\n- Scan millions of websites for known vulnerabilities\n- Automatically generate and test exploits\n- Chain multiple small vulnerabilities into major breaches\n\n**Speed difference:** What took hackers weeks now takes hours.\n\n#### 4. Voice Cloning & Vishing\n\nAI voice cloning has reached the point where it can:\n\n- Replicate any voice with 30 seconds of sample audio\n- Real-time voice conversion during phone calls\n- Bypass voice-based authentication systems\n\n---\n\n## AI-Powered Defense: Fighting Fire with Fire\n\nThe good news?
